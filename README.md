### notes on libgphoto2
Ports have a tendency to stay open with Canon 7D. Look for lingering usb port files with `lsof | grep usb` and also in the activity monitor.
Once the port is cleared and you run the application and leave it running it should remain in control of the camera from then on to at least when the app is shutdown.
quick testing out of the app with `gphoto2 --summary` and `gphoto2 --capture-and-download`
